# Benchmarking sorting algorithms
# 46887 Computational Thinking with Algorithms

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- [Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
- [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/)
- [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
- [matplotlib: Python plotting library](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

### Installing
Download and install the Anaconda distribution of Python from the link above. The other packages (Jupyter notebook, Pandas, matplotlib, NumPy) come as part of that distribution.

### Project repository
This project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) at 
https://github.com/elizabethdaly/comp-thinking-project.git

The analysis takes the form of a single Jupyter notebook of filename **EDalySortingAlg.ipynb**
The project report is in **FinalProject.pdf**

## How to clone this repository
A repository on GitHub exists as a remote repository. You can clone this repository to create a local copy on your computer by following these instructions:
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository https://github.com/elizabethdaly/comp-thinking-project
2. Under the repository name, click Clone or download.
3. Choose "Clone with HTTPS".
4. Open a terminal on your machine. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
5. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in 2 above.
```
git clone https://github.com/elizabethdaly/comp-thinking-project
```
6. Press enter to clone the repository to your machine.

## Static version of the notebook
Alternatively, one can view a static version of the notebook using [Jupyter Nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Enter the GitHub url to view the file. Actually, I realized that I cannot do this with a private repository. I'll leave the instruction here anyway for when I make the repository public after the submission date.
